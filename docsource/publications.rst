Decomposing three-dimensional shapes into self-supporting discrete element assemblies
=====================================================================================

.. [Frick2015] Frick et al. 2015. Decomposing three-dimensional shapes into self-supporting discrete element assemblies.

**Ursula Frick, Tom Van Mele and Philippe Block**

    This study investigates a computational design approach to generate volumetric
    decompositions of given, arbitrary, three-dimensional shapes into self supporting,
    discrete-element assemblies.
    These assemblies are structures formed by individual units that remain in equilibrium
    solely as a result of compressive and frictional contact forces between the elements.
    This paper presents a prototypical implementation of a decomposition tool into a
    CAD software, focusing on user-controlled design to generate such assemblies.
    The implementation provides an interactive design environment including real time
    visual feedback, in which the design space of self-supporting block assemblies can
    be explored and expanded. 
    Some surprising results of such explorations are included and discussed.

Data management and modelling of complex interfaces in imperfect discrete-element assemblies
============================================================================================

.. [Frick2016] Data management and modelling of complex interfaces in imperfect discrete-element assemblies.

**Ursula Frick, Tom Van Mele and Philippe Block**

    Recent advances in digital fabrication and on-site construction have created new 
    possibilities for the (pre-) fabrication of highly customised building components
    and the realisation of complex, assembled architectural geometries.
    However, currently there are no structural design methods or tools available that
    address the specific challenges related to the design and analysis of discrete assemblies.
    This paper describes an approach for the identification of contact interfaces between
    the  elements of discrete assemblies and presents a data structure for these interactions.
    Furthermore, the paper presents a method for handling misaligned (e.g. intersecting),
    and non-coplanar interfaces.
    The proposed approaches are suitable as computational back-end for equilibrium analysis
    of discrete-element assemblies, such as the Rigid Block Limit Equilibrium method.
